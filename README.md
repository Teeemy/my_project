# my_project
Git is a versatile version control system that enables developers to efficiently manage and track modifications made to their code over time. By creating a detailed history of changes, Git empowers teams to collaborate seamlessly, experiment freely, and revert to previous versions when needed.
I am creating a new git repository to perform basic version control operations such as pull,push and commit.
